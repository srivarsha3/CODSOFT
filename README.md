Welcome to my AI internship portfolio developed during my time with CodSoft. This repository contains five hands-on tasks demonstrating core Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning concepts using Python and modern libraries.
üîé Task 1: Face Detection and Recognition

Project Overview: This application detects and recognizes human faces in real-time using webcam input. It utilizes Haar cascades for face detection and matches input faces with stored labeled images using grayscale comparison (Mean Squared Error).

Tech Stack: OpenCV, NumPy, Python

Features:

    Real-time face detection via Haar cascades

    Manual pixel-level face recognition

    Webcam video feed with labeled bounding boxes

    Easily upgradable to ArcFace or Siamese networks

üìä Task 2: Data Visualization Dashboard

Project Overview: An interactive dashboard that visualizes tabular data from CSV or Excel files. The dashboard supports multiple chart types including bar, line, pie, and scatter plots with filtering options.

Tech Stack: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Streamlit

Features:

    Upload CSV or Excel files for analysis

    Dynamic visualizations with filters

    Streamlit-powered UI for smooth user experience

üìù Task 3: Sentiment Analysis on Tweets

Project Overview: A tweet sentiment classification project that labels tweets as positive, negative, or neutral. It uses NLP preprocessing, TF-IDF vectorization, and traditional classifiers for prediction.

Tech Stack: Pandas, Scikit-learn, NLTK

Features:

    Cleans tweet text (removing emojis, links, mentions)

    Trains classifier using labeled dataset

    Outputs sentiment score and visualization charts

üéØ Task 4: Resume Screening Bot

Project Overview: A smart resume screening bot that reads applicant resumes, extracts relevant sections, and matches them with job descriptions to shortlist the most relevant candidates.

Tech Stack: PyPDF2/docx2txt, SpaCy, Pandas

Features:

    Extracts data from DOCX and PDF resumes

    Highlights key skills and experience sections

    Scores resumes based on JD alignment

üó£Ô∏è Task 5: Voice Assistant Using Python

Project Overview: A Python-based voice assistant that can respond to commands like web searches, file opening, telling time, and answering general queries. It uses speech recognition and text-to-speech engines.

Tech Stack: speech_recognition, pyttsx3, Wikipedia API

Features:

    Voice command recognition

    Responds via TTS output

    Executes basic tasks like browsing, app launching, and querying info
