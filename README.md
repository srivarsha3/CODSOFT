üß† Task 1: Face Detection and Recognition

Description:

This project implements a real-time Face Detection and Recognition system using OpenCV and NumPy. The application detects faces from video streams using Haar cascade classifiers and recognizes known individuals by comparing grayscale facial images.

Key Features:

    Manual image preprocessing without high-level libraries

    Simple recognition using Mean Squared Error over pixel data

    Live webcam integration with labeling and bounding boxes

    Easily extendable to deep learning-based detectors and Siamese networks

üìä Task 2: Data Visualization Dashboard

Description:

A dynamic data visualization dashboard built with Python‚Äôs Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly. It takes CSV or Excel files and presents interactive charts, including bar graphs, pie charts, scatter plots, and trend analysis visuals.

Key Features:

    Supports multiple data formats

    Real-time updates with filter options

    User-friendly dashboard layout using Streamlit

üìù Task 3: Sentiment Analysis on Tweets

Description:

A sentiment analysis model that classifies tweets as Positive, Negative, or Neutral. The system uses preprocessed Twitter data and builds a classifier using techniques like TF-IDF vectorization and a supervised learning model (e.g., Logistic Regression, SVM, or Naive Bayes).

Key Features:

    Cleans noisy social media text (emojis, URLs, hashtags)

    Visualizes sentiment distribution using graphs

    Exportable model for integration into apps or APIs

üéØ Task 4: Resume Screening Bot

Description:

This bot automates resume screening using NLP techniques. It reads PDF or DOCX resumes, extracts key sections like Education, Experience, and Skills, then matches them against job descriptions using keyword and semantic similarity.

Key Features:

    PDF/DOCX parser using PyPDF2 or docx2txt

    Smart scoring system based on JD-relevance

    Filtered output showing top candidates

üó£Ô∏è Task 5: Voice Assistant Using Python

Description:

A Python-based voice assistant capable of recognizing commands using Speech Recognition and responding using Text-to-Speech (TTS). It performs tasks like web searches, opening applications, sending emails, and telling the time/date.

Key Features:

    Natural voice interaction using speech_recognition and pyttsx3

    Modular design for custom command extension

    Offline functionality for basic tasks
